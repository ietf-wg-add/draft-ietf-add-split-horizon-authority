      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>To resolve a DNS query, there are three main behaviors that an
      implementation can apply: (1) answer from a local database, (2) query
      the relevant authorities and their parents, or (3) ask a server to query
      those authorities and return the final answer. Implementations that use
      these behaviors are called "authoritative nameservers", "full/recursive
      resolvers", and "forwarders" (or "stub resolvers") respectively. However, an
      implementation can also implement a mixture of these behaviors,
      depending on a local policy, for each query. Such an implementation
      is termed a "hybrid resolver".</t>
      <t>Most DNS resolvers are hybrids of some kind. For example, stub
      resolvers support a local "hosts file" that preempts query
      forwarding, and most DNS forwarders and full resolvers can also serve
      responses from a local zone file. Other standardized hybrid resolution
      behaviors include <xref target="RFC8806">Local Root</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC6762">mDNS</xref>, and <xref target="RFC7686">NXDOMAIN
      synthesis for .onion</xref>.</t>
      <t>Networks usually offer clients a DNS resolver using means such as
      (e.g., DHCP OFFER, IPv6 Router Advertisement). Although this resolver is
      formally specified as a recursive resolver (e.g., <relref section="5.1"
      target="RFC8106"/>), some networks provide a hybrid resolver
      instead. If this resolver acts as an authoritative server for some names
      and provides different answers for those domains depending on the source
      of the query, it is described as the network having "split-horizon DNS", because those
      names resolve in this way only from inside the network.</t>
      <t>DNS clients that use pure stub resolution, sending all queries to
      the network-provided resolver, will always receive the split-horizon
      results. Conversely, clients that send all queries to a different
      resolver or implement pure full resolution locally will never receive
      them. Clients that strictly implement either of these resolution behaviors are out of scope for
      this specification. Instead, this specification enables hybrid clients
      to access split-horizon results from a network-provided hybrid resolver,
      while using a different resolution method for some or all other
      names.</t>
      <t>There are several existing mechanisms for a network to provide
      clients with "local domain hints", listing domain names that have
      special treatment in this network (e.g., <xref target="RFC6731">
      RDNSS Selection</xref>, <xref target="RFC5986">
      "Access Network Domain Name"</xref>, and "Client FQDN" <xref
      target="RFC4702"/><xref target="RFC4704"/> in DHCP, "dnsZones" in
      Provisioning Domains <xref target="RFC8801"/>, and <xref
      target="RFC8598">INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN</xref> in IKEv2).
      However, none of the local domain hint mechanisms enables clients to
      determine whether this special treatment is authorized by the domain
      owner. Instead, these specifications require clients to make their own
      determinations about whether to trust and rely on these hints.</t>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism between domain names, networks,
      and clients that allows the network to establish its authority over a
      domain to a client (<xref target="establishing"/>). Clients can
      use this protocol to confirm that a local domain hint was authorized by
      the domain owner (<xref target="validating"/>), which might influence
      its processing of that hint.  This process requires cooperation between
      the local DNS zone and the public zone.</t>
      <t>This specification relies on securely identified local DNS servers,
      and checks each local domain hint against a globally valid parent zone.</t>

      used throughout the document:</t>
      <dl>
        <dt>Encrypted DNS</dt><dd>A DNS protocol that provides an

      </dl>
      <t>In this document, the terms 'owner' and 'operator' are used interchangeably

    <section>
      <name>Scope</name>
      <t>The protocol in this document is designed to support the ability of
      a domain owner to create or authorize a split-horizon view of their
      domain. The protocol does not support split-horizon views created by
      any other entity. Thus, DNS filtering is not enabled by this protocol.</t>
      <t>The protocol is applicable to any type of network offering
      split-horizon DNS configuration. The endpoint does not need any prior
      configuration to confirm that a local domain hint was indeed authorized
      by the domain.</t>
      <t>All of the special-use domain names registered with IANA <xref target="RFC6761"/>,
      most notably ".home.arpa", "resolver.arpa.", "ipv4only.arpa." and ".local", are never
      unique to a specific DNS server's authority. All special-use domain names are outside the
      scope of this document and MUST NOT be validated using the mechanism described in this document. </t>
      <t> Use of this specification is limited to DNS servers that support authenticated encryption and
      split-horizon DNS names that are rooted in the global DNS.</t>

      <name>Requirements</name>
      <t>This solution seeks to fulfill the following requirements:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>No loss of security: No unauthorized party can impersonate
          a zone unless they could already do so without use of this
          specification.</li>
        <li>Least privilege: Local resolvers do not hold any
          secrets that could weaken the security of the public zone if
          compromised.</li>
        <li>Local zone confidentiality: The specification does not leak
          local network subdomains to anyone outside of the network.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: The specification can represent and authorize
          a Split DNS zone structure.</li>
        <li>DNSSEC Compatibility: The specification supports DNSSEC-based
          <xref target="RFC9364"/> object security for local zone contents.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section anchor="establishing">
      <name>Establishing Local DNS Authority</name>
      <t>A participating network <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> offer one or more
      encrypted resolvers via DHCP and Router Advertisement Options for the
      Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) <xref target="RFC9463"/>,
      Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) <xref target="RFC9462"/>, or an
      equivalent mechanism (see <xref target="vpn"/>).</t>
      <t>To establish local authority, the network MUST convey one or more
      "Authorization Claims" to the client.  An "Authorization Claim" is an
      abstract structure comprising:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>An Authentication Domain Name (ADN) of a local encrypted resolver.</li>
        <li>The DNS name of the authorizing parent zone.</li>
        <li>A set of subdomains of this parent zone that are claimed by
            the named local resolver (potentially including the entire parent
            zone). To claim the entire parent zone, the claimed subdomain
            will be represented as an asterisk symbol "*".</li>
        <li>A ZONEMD Hash Algorithm (<relref section="5.3" target="RFC8976"/>).
           For interoperability purposes implementations MUST support the
           "mandatory to implement" hash algorithms defined in
           <relref section="2.2.3" target="RFC8976"/>. </li>
        <li>A high-entropy salt, up to 255 octets.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>If the local encrypted resolver is identified by name (e.g., DNR), that
      identifying name MUST be the one used in any corresponding Authorization
      Claim.  Otherwise (e.g., DDR using IP addresses), the resolver MUST
      present a validatable certificate containing a subjectAltName that
      matches the Authorization Claim using the validation techniques for
      matching as described in <xref target="RFC9525"/>.</t>
      <t>The network then provides each Authorization Claim to the parent zone operator.
      If the contents are approved, the parent zone operator computes a "Verification Token"
      according to the following procedure:</t>
      <ol>
        <li>Convert all subdomains into canonical form and sort them in canonical
            order (<relref section="6" target="RFC4034"/>).</li>
        <li>Replace the suffix corresponding to the parent zone with a zero
            octet.</li>
        <li>Let $X be the concatenation of the resulting pseudo-FQDNs.</li>
        <li>Let len($SALT) be the number of octets of salt, as a single octet.</li>
        <li>Let $TOKEN = hash(len($SALT) || $SALT || $X). Where "||" denotes concatenation and hash is the ZONEMD Hash Algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The zone operator then publishes a "Verification Record" with the
      following structure, following advices such as in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques"/>:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>Type = TXT.</li>
        <li>Owner Name = Concatenation of the ADN, "_splitdns-challenge", and
            the parent zone name.</li>
        <li>Contents = "key/value" pairs, e.g., "token=base64url($TOKEN)" (without padding)</li>
      </ul>
      <t>By publishing this record, the parent zone authorizes the local
      encrypted resolver to serve these subdomains authoritatively.</t>
      <section>
        <name>Example</name>
        <t>Consider the following authorization claim:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>ADN = "resolver17.parent.example"</li>
          <li>Parent = "parent.example"</li>

      <t>To validate an Authorization Claim provided by the network, DNS clients
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> resolve the Verification Record for that name.
      If the resolution produces an RRSet containing the expected token for this
      Claim, the client <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> regard the named resolver as
      authoritative for the claimed subdomains. Clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore
      any unrecognized keys in the Verification Record.</t>
      <t>Each validation of authority applies only to a specific ADN.
      If a network offers multiple encrypted resolvers, each claimed

      <t>A zone is termed a "Validated Split-Horizon zone" after successful
      validation using a "tamperproof" DNS resolution method, i.e., a method
      that is not subject to interference by the local network operator. Two
      possible tamperproof resolution methods are presented below.</t>
      <section anchor="validating-external">
        <name>Using a Pre-configured External Resolver</name>
        <t>This method applies only if the client is already configured with
        a default resolution strategy that sends queries to a resolver outside
        of the network over a encrypted transport.  That resolution strategy is
        considered "tamperproof" because any actor who could modify the
        response could already modify all of the user's other DNS responses.</t>
        <t>To ensure that this assumption holds, clients <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
        relax the acceptance rules they would otherwise apply when using this
        resolver. For example, if the client would check the Authenticated Data (AD)
        bit or validate RRSIGs locally when using this resolver, it must also do so
        when resolving TXT records for this purpose. Alternatively, a client might
        perform DNSSEC validation for the verification query

      <name>Delegating DNSSEC across Split DNS Boundaries</name>
      <t>When the local zone can be signed with globally trusted keys for the parent
      zone, support for DNSSEC can be accomplished simply by placing a zone cut at
      the parent zone and including a suitable DS record for the local resolver's
      DNSKEY.  Zones in this configuration appear the same to validating stubs whether
      or not they implement this specification.</t>
      <t>To enable DNSSEC validation of local DNS names without requiring
      the local resolver to hold DNSSEC private keys that are valid for the parent
      zone, parent zones <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> add a "ds=..." key to the Verification
      Record whose value is the RDATA of a single DS record, base64url-encoded. This
      DS record authorizes a DNSKEY whose Owner Name is "resolver.arpa."</t>
      <t>To validate DNSSEC, the client first fetches and validates the Verification
      Record.  If it is valid and contains a "ds" key, the client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
      send a DNSKEY query for "resolver.arpa." to the local encrypted resolver.
      At least one resulting DNSKEY RR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match the DS RDATA from
      the "ds" key in the Verification Record. All local resolution results for
      subdomains in this claim <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> offer RRSIGs that chain to a
      DNSKEY whose RDATA is identical to one of these approved DNSKEYs.</t>
      <t>The "ds" key <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> appear multiple
      times in a single Verification Record, in order to authorize multiple DNSKEYs
      for this local encrypted resolver.  If the "ds" key is not present in a valid
      Verification Record, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> disable DNSSEC validation
      when resolving the claimed subdomains via this local encrypted resolver.</t>
      <t>Note that in this configuration, any claimed subdomains MUST be marked as
      unsigned in the public DNS.  Otherwise, resolution results would be rejected
      by validating stubs that do not implement this specification.</t>

      company (e.g., <tt>*.example.com</tt>). In the second example, the

      <name>Operational Efficiency in Split-Horizon Deployments</name>
        <t>In many split-horizon deployments, all non-public domain names are
        placed in a separate child zone (e.g., <tt>internal.example.com</tt>).
        In this configuration, the message flow is similar to <xref
        target="internal-only"/>, except that queries for hosts not within the
        subdomain (e.g., <tt>www.example.com</tt>) are sent to the
        external resolver rather than the resolver for internal.example.com.</t>
        <t>As in <xref target="internal-only"/>, the internal DNS
        server will need a certificate signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by the
        client.</t>
        <t>Although placing internal domains inside a child domain is unnecessary to prevent leakage,
        such placement reduces the frequency of changes to the Verification Record, this document
        recommends the internal domains be kept in a child zone of the local domain hints
        advertised by the network. For example, if the PvD "dnsZones" entry is
        "internal.example.com" and the network-provided DNS resolver is "ns1.internal.example.com",
        the network operator can structure the internal domain names as
        "private1.internal.example.com", "private2.internal.example.com",
        etc. The network-designated resolver will be used to resolve the subdomains of
        the local domain hint "*.internal.example.com".</t>

      <name>Authorization Claim Update</name>
      <t>A verification record is only valid until it expires. Expiry occurs when the Time To Live (TTL)

      fetch the verification records again and repeat the verification procedure. This ensures the
      availability of updated and valid verification records.</t>
      <t>A new verification record must be added to the RRset before the corresponding Authorization

        <li>DHCP reconfiguration can be initiated by the DHCP server to prompt DHCP clients for

        renewal to be driven by the DHCP server.</li>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The Authentication Domain Names of authorized local encrypted resolvers are
      revealed in the Owner Names of Verification Records.  This makes it easier for
      domain owners to understand which resolvers they are currently authorizing to
      implement Split DNS. However, this could create a confidentiality issue if the
      local encrypted resolver's name contains sensitive information or is part of a
      secret subdomain. To mitigate the impact of such leakage, local resolvers should
      be given names that do not reveal any sensitive information.</t>
      <t> The security properties of hashing algorithms are not fixed. Algorithm Agility
      (see <xref target="RFC7696"/>) is achieved by providing implementations with
      flexibility to choose hashing algorithms from the ZONEMD Schemes registry
      (<relref target="RFC8976" section="5.2" displayFormat="comma"/>).</t>
      <t>The entropy of salt depends on a high-quality pseudo-random number generator.
      For further discussion on random number generation, see <xref target="RFC4086"/>.
      The salt MUST be regenerated whenever the authorization claim is updated.</t>

          <t>It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed for
          registry change requests.</t>

          <t>Criteria that should be applied by the designated experts include
          determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
          entries and whether the registration description is clear and fits
          the purpose of this registry.</t>

          <t>Registration requests are evaluated within a three-week review period
          on the advice of one or more designated experts. Within the review
          period, the designated experts will either approve or deny the
          registration request, communicating this decision to IANA. Denials
          should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to
          how to make the request successful.</t>
